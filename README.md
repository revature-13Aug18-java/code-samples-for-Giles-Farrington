**Project 0 - Banking Application:**
	
My goal for project zero was to create a mock banking ATM system, with user interaction through only the console.
	
Users are able to:
	* Create a user account with username and password
	* Login/logout with user account
	* Create bank accounts (checking or savings) and name them
	* Delete bank accounts
	* Deposit and withdraw into created accounts
	* View balance on accounts 

**Project 1 - Expense Reimbursement System:**
	
For project one I created an employee expense reimbursement system as a single page web application. 
	
Users are able to:

* Access the application through their browser
* Create an employee account 
* Create a finance manager account
* Login/logout with desired account type
* Employee accounts can create reimbursement 
* Employees can view previously submitted reimbursements and see whether they are pending, denied, or approved
* Finance managers can view every submitted reimbursement request from all employees
* Finance managers can filter reimbursements to only view pending 
* Finance managers can approve or deny pending reimbursements 

**Project 2 - Revature Events Application:**
	
Revature has specific events for employees usually determined on a monthly basis. 
These events include recurring events such as gameboard night, where employees get together and play popular boardgames 
and enjoy pizza provided by Revature. Some other examples of events are bicycle rides and Linkedin photo ops.
These events provided are all organized through paper, such as posters to advertise event and sign-up sheets to sign up.
Our goal was to provide an electronic source to organize, view, and sign-up for these events through a single page web application.
	
Revature employees are able to:

	* Access application through browser
	* Create an account
	* Update account information
	* Login/logout with created account
	* View upcoming events on homepage
	* Create an event 
	* Search for specific events 
	* RSVP to an event 
	* View information and location of a specific event 
	

**Project 3 - RideForce Rideshare Application:**

For new Revature employees without a car, it can be difficult to find a ride to work without expensive alternatives.
This initial difficulty for some new employees may turn them off from the Revature experience.
Thus our goal was to create a mobile friendly single page web application in which employees can interact with eachother to determine rides in a simple and intuitive manner.
	
Revature employees are able to:

	* Access application through phone/desktop browser
	* Trainers can create accounts and generate code for their batch to create accounts
	* New employees can create an account with a generated code given by their trainer
	* When registering new account determine whether a driver and can give rides or a passenger and looking for rides
	* Login/logout with created account 
	* View information on how to use the application through the about page
	* Edit account information
	* If passenger account, able to swipe through drivers, view some information about them, and like/dislike them
	* Order of swipeable drivers determined by location, so closer drivers will appear first
	* Drivers can view profiles which have liked them, view their profile and like/dislike them
	* If passenger and driver like eachother, they can view contact information and contact eachother about future rides
	* View map where it focuses on your location and pins are located where nearby drivers/employees currently reside
	* View list of drivers which you have previously liked
